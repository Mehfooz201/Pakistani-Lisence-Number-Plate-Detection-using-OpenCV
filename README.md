# Pakistani License Plate Detection using OpenCV and Machine Learning
This project is aimed at developing an automated system for detecting and reading license plates of vehicles in Pakistan using Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques. The system is designed to capture images of vehicles and then process them to extract the license plate numbers. It then uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the numbers into text format and perform data cleaning to remove unwanted characters.

## Features
The features of this project include:
- License plate detection using OpenCV
- OCR to read text from the detected license plate image
- Data cleaning to remove unwanted characters
- Matching the extracted license plate number with the given input data
- Easy integration with existing systems
- Potential Use Cases

## This system can be used in various applications including:
- Toll Plaza systems to automate toll collection
- University parking systems to manage parking spaces
- Industry and companies' security systems for access control
- Parking security systems to monitor unauthorized vehicles
- Requirements

## To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Pytesseract library for OCR
- Numpy and Pandas libraries for data processing
